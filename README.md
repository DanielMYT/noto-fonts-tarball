# noto-fonts-tarball
Noto fonts packaged into a tarball for Linux and other Unix-like systems.

Originally developed for the build system of MassOS. Forked by DanielMYT primarily for personal use. Do NOT expect regular updates or maintenance.

If you want to obtain Noto fonts, it is strongly recommended to use your distro's packages, or download them directly from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto).

For licensing information, please see the comment at the start of the `package.sh` script.
